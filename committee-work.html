			<h2>Committee Work</h2>

			<h5>Fall 2018</h5>
			<p>For my first semester at TIU, I was a "rover", which meant I helped out wherever I was needed with different committees at TIU. One thing I was asked to do is teach the ASP class for students who are interested in studying abroad. It was a lot of fun teaching a lesson on American university culture and cultural differences. Another thing I did was help design and tweak the code a little bit for the PAW website (our peer writing advisors program). You can see their website here: <a href="https://tiugtipaw.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">TIU GTI PAW</a>. Finally, I assisted with creating a schedule for our English Plaza and Academic Advising shifts for spring semester. It's amazing the amount of work that goes into working with 50 teachers' schedules to fit them into our English Plaza shifts!</p>

			<h5>Spring 2019</h5>
			<p>This semester I was much busier with committee work as I joined the Tech Committee. Here are some things I worked on throughout the semester:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I managed cancellations of English Plaza duties by surveying teachers who were eligible to cancel a shift and canceling them in the Eventbrite system.</li>
				<li>I regularly updated the GTI Handbook and TIU GTI website.</li>
				<li>I helped to download English Plaza data from Eventbrite.</li>
				<li>I wrote a script to fix an issue we had with Google Calendar. Google was duplicating some calendar entries that teachers submitted. You can see the code <a href="https://github.com/stephr3/google-sheets-scripts/blob/master/calendarCode.js" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
				<li>I helped to write a script that allowed the SLI Committee to add timestamps to multiple columns in a Google Sheets document. See the code <a href="https://github.com/stephr3/google-sheets-scripts/blob/master/addTimestamps.js" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
				<li>I helped again with English Plaza Scheduling. It went pretty smoothly this year!</li>
				<li>I helped to create and publish biography pages for new GTFs on our TIU GTI website.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I really enjoyed my time working on the tech team this semester. There are many technical needs that arise for a large language program like GTI. I look forward to continuing my work with tech team next term!</p>
