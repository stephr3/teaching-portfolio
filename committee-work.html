			<h5 id="2018-committee">Fall 2018</h5>
			<p>For my first semester at TIU, I was a "rover", which meant I helped out wherever I was needed with different committees at TIU. One thing I was asked to do is teach the ASP class for students who are interested in studying abroad. It was a lot of fun teaching a lesson on American university culture and cultural differences. Another thing I did was help design and tweak the code a little bit for the PAW website (our peer writing advisors program). You can see their website here: <a href="https://tiugtipaw.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">TIU GTI PAW</a>. Finally, I assisted with creating a schedule for our English Plaza and Academic Advising shifts for spring semester. It's amazing the amount of work that goes into working with 50 teachers' schedules to fit them into our English Plaza shifts!</p>

			<h5 id="2019-committee">Spring 2019</h5>
			<p>This semester I was much busier with committee work as I joined the Tech Committee. Here are some things I worked on throughout the semester:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I managed cancellations of English Plaza duties by surveying teachers who were eligible to cancel a shift and canceling them in the Eventbrite system.</li>
				<li>I regularly updated the GTI Handbook and TIU GTI website.</li>
				<li>I helped to download English Plaza data from Eventbrite.</li>
				<li>I wrote a script to fix an issue we had with Google Calendar. Google was duplicating some calendar entries that teachers submitted. You can see the code <a href="https://github.com/stephr3/google-sheets-scripts/blob/master/calendarCode.js" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
				<li>I helped to write a script that allowed the SLI Committee to add timestamps to multiple columns in a Google Sheets document. See the code <a href="https://github.com/stephr3/google-sheets-scripts/blob/master/addTimestamps.js" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
				<li>I helped again with English Plaza Scheduling. It went pretty smoothly this year!</li>
				<li>I helped to create and publish biography pages for new GTFs on our TIU GTI website.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h5>Fall 2019</h5>
			<p>This semester I continued my work with the Tech Committee. Here are some things I worked on throughout the semester, in addition to the usual Eventbrite data downloads and website updates:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I updated new teacher biographical data on the GTI Handbook.</li>
				<li>I gave an informal presentation to Japanese IT staff on Eventbrite and how the GTI uses it.</li>
				<li>I helped create Excel sheets to manage class scheduling and English Plaza Scheduling. I also participated extensively in both processes. They went pretty well this year!</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>I really enjoyed my time working on the tech team this semester. There are many technical needs that arise for a large language program like GTI. I look forward to continuing my work with tech team next term!</p>

			<h5 id="2020-committee">Spring 2020</h5>
			<p>This year we took the unprecedented step of moving all classes online due to the pandemic emergency. In addition to completing the usual Tech Committee duties, I completed the following work this semester to aid in that transition:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Presented an in-person training on Zoom.</li>
				<li>Assisted in answering Zoom related questions throughout the start of the semester.</li>
				<li>Assisted in transitioning English Lounge and Academic Advising to Zoom.</li>
				<li>Wrote an Eventbrite Script to automatically download data. See the code <a href="https://github.com/stephr3/eventbrite-api/blob/master/get_eventbrite_data_by_series.rb" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
				<li>Wrote another script to create events based on manually created templates. See the code <a href="https://github.com/stephr3/eventbrite-api/blob/master/create_eventbrite_workshops.rb" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I also participated in some off-committee activities, which I enjoyed:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Provided tech support for a panel discussion event: "The Struggle for Justice and Equality: African American Perspectives and Analysis of Recent Social Unrest in the US and Worldwide".</li>
				<li>Created and edited some video content for "What's Up GTI" in addition to a thank you video for our bosses!</li>
			</ul>

			<h5>Fall 2020</h5>
			<p>Tasks I completed this semester:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Performed regular downloads of English Plaza attendance.</li>
				<li>Set up Eventbrite events for Zoom and in-person English Plaza meetings.</li>
				<li>Added student intern bios to our website.</li>
				<li>Assisted with class scheduling and English Plaza scheduling.</li>
				<li>Updated the team on new Zoom features.</li>
			</ul> 
			<p>I also created a cooking video for "What's Up GTI". Check it out here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp1io101WDQ">GTI Kitchen</a></p>

			<h5 id="2021-committee">Spring 2021</h5>
			<p>This semester we moved to an on-demand format and also had teachers switching over to Moodle for their primary learning management system. Another busy semester for the tech team! What I did:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Set up spreadsheet to help with English Plaza schedule making.</li>
				<li>Assisted with fall semester class scheduling.</li>
				<li>Created buttons, templates, and Academic Advising events for Eventbrite.</li>
				<li>Provided some design feedback for the new campus globalization website.</li>
				<li>Compiled information on hybrid teaching.</li>
				<li>Performed trouble shooting for Eventbrite issues.</li>
				<li>Updated our WordPress site and shared Moodle site.</li>			
			</ul>

			<h5>Fall 2021</h5>
			<p>This semester, I spent the first month with the tech team, and then made my official switch to Digital Media. With the tech team, I helped to organize and set up the Eventbrite events for English Plaza. Once I switched to Digital Media, I learned the ropes of hosting, filming, and editing videos with Final Cut Pro.</p>

			<p>Here are some projects I worked on this term:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5fxXvQeq-Y">Tech Tips - Keyboard Shortcuts</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Oenq4n1fcY">Spotlight - Fall Food and Drinks</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cajKOimyrY0">Haiku in the Hallway - Halloween Edition</a></li>
			</ul>

			<h5 id="2022-committee">Spring 2022</h5>
			<p>In spring, I continued working with the Digital Media committee. We got a little creative this semester by doing a video on Katakana vs. English words, and I continued my tech tips series. Check out the videos below!</p>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMWCm6GmqOA">Tech Tips - Formatting a Paragraph in Google Docs</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4MfOhvNaws">Spotlight - Katakana vs. English</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r59OHvCK82U">Spotlight - Student Leadership Interns</a></li>
			</ul>

			<p>Next semester, the committee will focus on creating videos about student projects and presentations, English Lounge advice, and curriculum content.</p>
