			<h2>Statement of Goals</h2>
			
			<div>
				<i class="fas fa-comments icon-left"></i>
				<p><span class="first-word">In</span> my first two years at TIU, I have learned a lot about working with my Japanese track students and encouraging them to utilize their L2 during class. Now, in my speaking and listening classes, students participate in daily class discussions with clear models and scaffolding provided. My new goal with these classes is to challenge students more in their spontaneous L2 use as well as to address their English Lounge communication techniques and experiences explicitly in class on a more regular basis. I'd also like to move from a mid-term class feedback form to a daily exit ticket system so that I can check in with students regarding what they've learned, what they're confused about, and any changes they would like to see in the class. I hope this will help me to open up a more consistent dialogue with students so that there are no surprises or mismatched expectations throughout the duration of the course. I have found that having a clear routine helps my class to run smoothly (especially while teaching online), and I hope that adding exit tickets to this daily routine will benefit the course design and help my students feel heard. </p>
			</div>

			<p>My second goal is related to my other passion in life: technology. Due to the circumstances of 2020, my students are using new technologies daily as tools to learn language, socialize with other students, and complete classwork. My challenge this year is to improve my development and design of materials for students by utilizing "user experience design" concepts that I learned during my time as a web developer. I want to create thoughtfully designed materials that are easy to follow along so as to reduce students' cognitive load and help them focus on learning the language concepts at hand.</p>

			<p>Thirdly, I'm hoping to continue to contribute to the TESOL field during this time of emergency remote teaching by sharing online tools that I have worked with in class. For example, a colleague and I are planning to give a demonstration on "Digital Storytelling with Google Earth" at the next JALT online conference. I would also like to present my experience with developing teaching materials using user experience design concepts at our TIU MyShare this semester. Though we are living in difficult times, the global teaching community has truly pulled together to share resources and ideas about how to help our students continue moving forward with their  education, and I hope to contribute to these conversations and resource pools in the coming year. </p>
