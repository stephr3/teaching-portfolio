			<h2>Statement of Goals</h2>

				<p><span class="first-word">Throughout</span> my first few months teaching at TIU, one of the most fascinating challenges I have encountered has been trying to encourage English use in a classroom where all of my students speak the same first language. In the past, most of my teaching experience was in mixed L1 classes, so English was a default shared language in class. Â In my Japanese track classes at TIU, I have noticed that classmates help each other in their L1, and I see value in that kind of peer support. At the same time, I realize that the short amount of time that my students spend with me each day might be the only time they get to practice authentic English language use.</p>
			</div>

			<p>I'm interested in researching both the advantages and disadvantages of using L1 in the classroom. I'd like to utilize students' native language as a strength and not just something to be constantly avoided. At the same time, I plan to research activities and teaching methodologies that encourage more English use in the classroom. I'm especially interested in creating a supportive classroom environment and using activities that can reduce students' anxiety around using English in front of their peers. I'm hoping to teach more speaking and listening classes in the future so that I can focus on encouraging my students to produce as much English as possible during class.</p>

			<p>Another strong interest of mine is technology in the classroom. Since many of my students have mobile phones and are fairly technically savvy with a smartphone, I would love to incorporate mobile apps and activities into class more often. I'd also like to use more online resources to help my students improve their technical literacy and reduce paper use. One activity that I found success with this semester was an augmented reality activity using the HP Reveal app. I am planning to hold a workshop for other GTFs about this app's use, and I hope I can use it more in the following semesters. I have also joined the JALT Mixed, Augmented, and Virtual Realities SIG and will attend some of the talks at the JALT conference this fall. I look forward to learning more about AR and VR resources that I can incorporate in class. My vision for the end of my first contract at TIU is that I will have an interactive class that uses technology to lower anxiety and support students' authentic and enthusiastic use of English.</p>
