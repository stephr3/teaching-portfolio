			<h2>Statement of Goals</h2>
			
			<div>
				<i class="fas fa-comments icon-left"></i>
				<p><span class="first-word">In 2021</span>, I not only taught three new elective courses, but GTI also transitioned to an on-demand and in-person format. All of my colleagues and myself were busy developing new syllabi, videos, online tools, and projects that could translate to both online and face-to-face environments.  Considering the challenges, I think my elective courses went pretty well! My first goal for the coming year is to refine and improve my feedback and assessments for my elective courses. I especially hope to improve the quality and timeliness of feedback that students receive. In order to do this, I plan to alter my curriculum and schedule to utilize more automated and in-class grading for smaller assignments so that I can spend more time creating thoughtful and focused feedback for larger digital projects, presentations, and writing assignments.</p>
			</div>

			<p>Next year, I will also have the opportunity to join the Digital Media committee. I am excited for this chance to learn more about video scripting, filming, editing, and the creation of supplemental materials for students. I will also begin an online certificate for Digital Media offered by Cork Institute of Technology in the fall. I am hoping to put my new skills to use with practical digital projects that will help foster a sense of community for our students as well as provide learning opportunities in class.</p>

			<p>Lastly, I hope to continue contributing to the TESOL field, especially in the area of educational technology, digital media, and design. Now more than ever, TESOL professionals are having to be quite innovative with how we integrate digital tools and projects in our classrooms. How can we continue fostering community and encouraging expression when students are online or only seeing each other once a week? These are all pertinent questions, and I hope to continue researching digital tools that can help us achieve these objectives. I plan to present on creating a LINE chatbot at a conference this fall, and I hope to implement more technical project-based work in classes that I can later share with colleagues or at conferences.</p>
