			<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>

				<p><span class="first-word">As</span> an English teacher, I see myself not as a provider of knowledge, but as a facilitator – one who helps students activate their own background knowledge and build up new connections and ideas. I hope that my students can learn not only to rely on me, but also to rely on themselves and their classmates to learn new concepts. I try to achieve this by creating a comfortable, interactive classroom environment where we study relevant topics and language. I encourage my students to communicate their own needs, expectations, and goals to me so that I can better facilitate their learning. I can then utilize a variety of methods and approaches based on my individual classes and student needs assessments.</p>
			</div>

			<p>One approach I have found to be useful is the social constructivist approach. This approach looks at language both as a tool to connect with others and as a vessel of culture, and  it emphasizes connection and cooperation among students (Beck & Kosnik, 2006). To apply this in the classroom, I plan group work and task-based activities to utilize students' unique backgrounds and knowledge. For example, my students might be "experts for a day", and share information they know about their hometown, chosen profession, or hobbies with the class. Students might even do their own research to present a poster session to other teachers and students at their language institute.</p>

			<p>I also use a task-based learning approach in my classroom. Students are asked to do real-life and useful tasks in the classroom, and language and structures are organically taught based on what is needed to complete the specified task (Larsen-Freeman, 1985).  One activity I have done is have students find a learning resource at their school and teach their classmates how to get there. A higher level group of students might publish a newsletter to share with other classes. Task-based learning can be combined with systematic vocabulary and grammar teaching to give students successful experience with everyday tasks that they may be faced with again outside the classroom.</p>

			<p>Another important aspect to my classroom is feedback and error correction, which may change depending on lesson objectives for the day. For example, if perfect production is the goal, I give outright and immediate error correction by repeating back a phrase or sentence correctly or asking students leading questions to fix their errors. On the other hand, if fluency is the goal for the day, I will instead focus on breakdowns in communication or errors in usage and meaning. One practice I've found useful during fluency activities is to take notes on common accuracy mistakes that I hear during a class activity. I can then focus the class on correcting these errors together after the activity is finished, so they can reflect on their accuracy as well as conversational fluency.</p>

			<p>By using multiple approaches to guide my class planning and staying flexible enough to respond to students' needs, I hope to create a comfortable and dynamic classroom environment. Part of the joy of teaching is that no class is ever the same, and I can constantly learn from student assessment and feedback which methods and approaches work best for a particular group of students. I look forward to continuing to grow and adjusting my teaching philosophy based on the daily lessons I learn from my students, colleagues, and research in the field.</p>
