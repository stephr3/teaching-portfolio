			<h5>Book Review: Design for How People Learn by Julie Dirksen</h5>
			<h6><em>September 2019</em></h6>
			<div class="image-small"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-People-Learn-Voices-Matter/dp/0134211286/"
					target="_blank"><img class="img-thumbnail image-small" src="../assets/design-for-how-people-learn.png" /></a>
			</div>
			<p><span class="first-word">Over</span> the summer, I decided to read a teaching book in order to brush up on my
				skills and prepare for the new semester. In our teaching library at TIU, Julie Dirksen's book, <a
					href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-People-Learn-Voices-Matter/dp/0134211286/" target="_blank">"Design for How
					People Learn"</a> immediately jumped out at me. I initially chose the book because, well, it has a very nice
				design. The cover is simple with bold colors, and when I flipped through the book I saw plenty of fun
				illustrations and examples. Dirksen truly practices what she preaches with this book - the book itself is
				designed to catch the reader's attention and teach concepts using relevant scenarios and easy-to-understand
				illustrations.</p>
			<p>In the book, Dirksen covers topics from needs analysis and setting class objectives to increasing student
				motivation and encouraging good habits. Please do note that Dirksen's experience is with adult learners, so most
				of the book focuses on examples related to adult workplace education. Her concept is simple: "...the goal of
				good learning design is for learners to emerge from the learning experience with new or improved capabilities
				that they can take back to the real world and that help them do the things they need or want to do" (Dirksen,
				2016). While the goal is simple, there are many moving parts that go into designing a strong learning program.
				Here are some key points that I took away from the reading:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It is important to figure out where "the gap" is between student knowledge and what needs to be learned.
					Understanding students' background knowledge and motivation is key.</li>
				<li>Consider why the students are in a course. "What bad thing will happen if they don't know" (Dirksen, 2016).
					Also, think about how proficient students really need to be in a skill at this point in their learning
					journey.</li>
				<li>Tips for memory retention: chunk information, have students do something with new information, ground
					information in context, and use storytelling.</li>
				<li>For practicing skills, it is important to avoid overloading students with information and to let them rest.
					Students need to practice the task so that their brain function can become more efficient, and they also need
					regular feedback to help them improve.</li>
				<li>In order to encourage motivation, reward students regularly and show them immediate feedback or consequences
					for their work. Make sure that information is "new, useful, and easy to use" (Dirksen, 2016). Help students to
					go outside of their comfort zones regularly in order to reduce anxiety about a task.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Dirksen has worked on designing e-learning for various workplace training courses, and I was happy to see the
				web development concepts of User Experience (UX) and User Interaction (UI) design influencing her work. In the
				context of web development, UI and UX are all about considering users' needs and designing simple, easy to use
				interactions tailored to those needs. Thinking about UI and UX design was one of my favorite things to do as a
				web developer, and I look forward to translating those ideas over to my classroom. I hope to implement her
				strong consideration of student backgrounds and needs along with some of her psychological tips and tricks for
				increasing student memory retention and motivation in my classroom. I highly recommend this book for anyone who
				would like a fresh, comprehensive take on learning that will the reader rethink and revamp their classroom.</p>

			<h5>Book Review: Telling Ain't Training by Harold D. Stolovitch and Erica J. Keeps</h5>
			<h6><em>August 2022</em></h6>
			<div class="image-small"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Telling-Aint-Training-Expanded-Enhanced/dp/1562867016"
					target="_blank"><img class="img-thumbnail image-small" src="../assets/telling-aint-training.png" /></a></div>
			<p><span class="first-word">I've</span> recently developed an interest in instructional design for adults, so
				after some research I decided to pick up the book <a
					href="https://www.amazon.com/Telling-Aint-Training-Expanded-Enhanced/dp/1562867016">"Telling Ain't
					Training"</a> to learn more about workplace training and other adult learning situations. I was also curious
				as to how I could adapt these ideas to my own courses, especially IT Literacy, which has a technical training
				component to it.</p>
			<p>The book employs a conversational tone and provides interactive exercises to test the reader's cognition as
				well as plan lessons and curriculum. It also provides plenty of examples from a variety of real-world training
				situations. The topics covered include adult learning principles, training models, and online and blended
				learning models.</p>
			<p>Here are some interesting points I learned from the book:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>"Training" teaches a learner to "consistently reproduce without variation", while "instruction helps
					learners generalize beyond the specifics of what is taught." It was interesting for me to break down what I
					need to "train" in my IT course (for example, how to create and publish a new page on a WordPress website) vs.
					what to "instruct" (teaching a student to google when they are not sure how to solve a technical problem, or
					encouraging lifelong learning in technology).</li>
				<li>To better retain information for long-term memory, students benefit from things like having their senses
					activated, chunking information, and understanding the purpose behind why something must be learned.</li>
				<li>It's important to differentiate between "declarative" and "procedural" knowledge, as training methods for
					these can vary. "Declarative" knowledge includes the ability to "name, explain, and talk about matters."
					"Procedural" knowledge allows us to "act and do things, to perform tasks."</li>
				<li>Adults learn better when knowledge solves a problem for them, provides an opportunity, or helps them to grow
					professionally.</li>
				<li>A five-step model for training is explored: Rationale, Objectives, Activities, Evaluation, and Feedback.
				</li>
				<li>I think the key point I took away from this book is that my learners' success is my success. I want to
					structure my classes as best as possible for my learners to succeed!</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I enjoyed reading this book. It had an easy tone, the information was well-structured and organized, and the
				activities and examples clearly laid out concepts. It gave me food for thought as to how I structure my classes,
				especially in setting clear goals, pointing out why skills will help students reach their own goals, and
				streamlining activities. I think many core concepts are shared between language learning and workplace training,
				and I'd love to continue learning about Instructional Design as a field.</p>
