			<h5>Book Review: Design for How People Learn by Julie Dirksen</h5>
			<h6><em>September 2019</em></h6>
			<div class="image-small"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-People-Learn-Voices-Matter/dp/0134211286/" target="_blank"><img class="img-thumbnail image-small" src="../assets/design-for-how-people-learn.png" /></a></div>
			<p><span class="first-word">Over</span> the summer, I decided to read a teaching book in order to brush up on my skills and prepare for the new semester. In our teaching library at TIU, Julie Dirksen's book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-People-Learn-Voices-Matter/dp/0134211286/" target="_blank">"Design for How People Learn"</a> immediately jumped out at me. I initially chose the book because, well, it has a very nice design. The cover is simple with bold colors, and when I flipped through the book I saw plenty of fun illustrations and examples. Dirksen truly practices what she preaches with this book - the book itself is designed to catch the reader's attention and teach concepts using relevant scenarios and easy-to-understand illustrations.</p>
			<p>In the book, Dirksen covers topics from needs analysis and setting class objectives to increasing student motivation and encouraging good habits. Please do note that Dirksen's experience is with adult learners, so most of the book focuses on examples related to adult workplace education. Her concept is simple: "...the goal of good learning design is for learners to emerge from the learning experience with new or improved capabilities that they can take back to the real world and that help them do the things they need or want to do" (Dirksen, 2016). While the goal is simple, there are many moving parts that go into designing a strong learning program. Here are some key points that I took away from the reading:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It is important to figure out where "the gap" is between student knowledge and what needs to be learned. Understanding students' background knowledge and motivation is key.</li>
				<li>Consider why the students are in a course. "What bad thing will happen if they don't know" (Dirksen, 2016). Also, think about how proficient students really need to be in a skill at this point in their learning journey.</li>
				<li>Tips for memory retention: chunk information, have students do something with new information, ground information in context, and use storytelling.</li>
				<li>For practicing skills, it is important to avoid overloading students with information and to let them rest. Students need to practice the task so that their brain function can become more efficient, and they also need regular feedback to help them improve.</li>
				<li>In order to encourage motivation, reward students regularly and show them immediate feedback or consequences for their work. Make sure that information is "new, useful, and easy to use" (Dirksen, 2016). Help students to go outside of their comfort zones regularly in order to reduce anxiety about a task.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Dirksen has worked on designing e-learning for various workplace training courses, and I was happy to see the web development concepts of User Experience (UX) and User Interaction (UI) design influencing her work. In the context of web development, UI and UX are all about considering users' needs and designing simple, easy to use interactions tailored to those needs. Thinking about UI and UX design was one of my favorite things to do as a web developer, and I look forward to translating those ideas over to my classroom. I hope to implement her strong consideration of student backgrounds and needs along with some of her psychological tips and tricks for increasing student memory retention and motivation in my classroom. I highly recommend this book for anyone who would like a fresh, comprehensive take on learning that will the reader rethink and revamp their classroom.</p>
