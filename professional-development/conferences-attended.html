			<h2>JALT 2018</h2>
<p><span class="first-word">I attended</span> <a href="https://jalt.org/conference/jalt2018" target="_blank">JALT 2018</a> in Shizuoka, Japan so that I could get a better idea of what types of research language professionals in Japan are working on. I was excited to attend the Technology in Teaching workshops, as I would like to create an action research project focusing on technology in the classroom. Below are some highlights of talks that I attended.</p>

<h5><i>“Regular Expressions for JavaScript”</i> presented by John Blake, University of Aizu</h5>

<p>I chose this workshop because I have web development experience and knowledge of JavaScript and regular expressions, and I was interested in how they could be used in a teaching context. Regular expressions are just a computerized way to search text for certain patterns. Mr. Blake demonstrated many interesting applications for regular expressions, including highlighting past tense “ed” pronunciation in a text, highlighting words from a pronunciation list in a reading text, and finally an app that finds mistake patterns in research papers. It was an interactive workshop, and I was able to play with code and regular expressions to try out different techniques. I think I’d be interested in developing my own program to use in writing classes. I could use regular expressions to search student papers and highlight common mistakes for students to read over and correct. I could also color code what types of mistakes are made to provide more guidance for students.</p>

<h5><i>“How to Transform your Classroom with AR and VR”</i> presented by Parisa Mehran, Osaka University</h5>

<p>This was a practical workshop that highlighted some useful AR and VR apps that can be used in class. During the workshop, I had a chance to talk to other teachers about their experience or ideas for using AR and VR in different EFL classroom contexts. I appreciated Ms. Mehran’s reasons for using VR and AR, which included harnessing the impossible, controlling perspective, boosting engagement, and stimulating senses. I also loved the idea of using Google Expeditions to give students a “world tour”, or to show students a city where they’d like to study abroad. As a teacher, I’m comfortable with using AR in class, but haven’t had any experience with VR. This presentation gave me some motivation to try and use a simple and cheap tool like Google Cardboard to incorporate VR in my classroom.</p> 

<h5><i>“Techniques and Principles in Language Teaching”</i> presented by  Diane Larsen-Freeman, University of Michigan</h5>

<p>On Saturday, I was pleased to watch a talk by Diane Larsen-Freeman, especially since I studied her book in my graduate program. I appreciated that she focused on the conference theme of “Diversity and Inclusion” for her talk. She related the idea of “Complex Systems” in nature to diversity in education. A key idea was that as a society, we are stronger with more diversity. As teachers, we need to not only recognize diversity, but also work to include all types of people and not expect everyone to “assimilate” to our teaching style. Larsen-Freeman gave  practical advice for teachers to address our own implicit bias in class by thinking about who we call on, how we group students, and whether we have the same expectations for all of our students. One interesting point she brought up regarding the Japanese language classroom was the importance of silence in the classroom, and learning to perhaps accept this silence from students as a sign of respect and learning.</p>  

<h5><i>“Is Conversation Teachable in L2 Classrooms?”</i> presented by John Campbell-Larsen, Kyoto Women’s University</h5>

<p>John Campbell-Larsen’s presentation challenged my notions of how to teach oral communication in class. He argued that most traditional activities in conversation classes (interviews, presentations, and role plays) are not actually practicing the conversation genre. He advocated for allotting regular time in class where students could freely form groups based on their own social connections and interests and discuss whatever they would like. He also pointed out many hurdles to this practice, including student, teacher, and institutional practices and beliefs. His talk encouraged me to learn more about conversation as a genre, and to trust my students to be able to initiate and carry on conversations more often in class without explicit roles, language points, or tasks assigned. This practice seems challenging to me and honestly I feel a bit uncomfortable running an activity with so little structure, but I think it would be interesting to give Mr. Campbell-Larsen’s methods a try to see if my students respond well to this type of free practice in class.</p>

<p><span class="first-word">Overall,</span> I found the JALT conference to be professionally run and full of interesting talks for every type of teaching interest. I enjoyed connecting with other teachers, especially in the “Mind, Body, and Spirit” room where I was able to relax and wind down with teachers from all over Japan by meditating and doing yoga! I look forward to attending more JALT events in the future.</p>
