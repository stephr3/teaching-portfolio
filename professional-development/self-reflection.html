			<h2>Self-Reflection</h2>
			<h5>Fall 2018</h5>
			<p>Overall my first semester was all about finding my way at TIU and getting to know my new students. I taught two J-track compulsory classes: English Communication and Basic Writing. One challenge is that I came in mid-way through the year to 1st-year students who had already learned and adjusted to the previous teacher's teaching style. In addition to this, I was figuring out the specific challenges that come with teaching reading and writing to university students who share the same first language.</p>
			<p>One goal I developed after my first month of teaching was to encourage more English use in the classroom. I worked on this by explicitly teaching classroom English, to mixed results. I think the key is to keep practicing and encouraging this classroom language daily. I also wanted to make sure the learning objectives for each class were simple and clear. I wanted to make sure students felt small successes and like they learned something each day. This is easier said than done when I was a new teacher still figuring out what my students truly needed to learn! One place I think I was more successful in this was in my writing class. I had the goal of teaching a simple writing process - first draft, revision, and final draft. I think by the end of the semester students had grasped the usefulness of this process.</p>
			<p>My Academic Composition class was interesting because it was a completely different population of students. I had nine students from various countries. All of them were quite motivated to improve their essay writing skills. Looking back on this class, I think I struggled balancing general composition skills with grammar and mechanics. I had a lower level class, and some students definitely struggled with writing clear and understandable sentences. I also struggled with feedback. How much feedback should I give? Was it really being read and utilized?</p>
			<p>If I were to teach this class again, I think I would try to create a clearer action plan for my students, building up from creating sentences to paragraphs and essays. I was a bit all over the place in trying to help my students with the many skills they needed to develop, from finding good sources and paraphrasing to using commas correctly and writing great transition sentences. I think it would have been beneficial for us to work on one skill at a time as a class to really master each step of the writing process, in addition to regular grammar and punctuation workshops.</p>
			<p>At the end of the term, I also reflected on writing feedback. One idea I had was to survey students on what types of feedback they prefer so I can tailor my feedback to each student individually. For example, do they prefer general comments on the whole paper, general comments on each paragraph, detailed grammar fixes on one or two paragraphs, or just a grade? This would be interesting to experiment with if I teach a writing class again.</p>

			<h5>Spring 2019</h5>
			<p>My goals for my second semester at TIU were as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create content that I'm proud of and share it on the shared Google Drive.</li>
				<li>Reflect regularly on my classes and get student feedback.</li>
				<li>Have clear and intentional goals for each course, unit, week, and class hour.</li>
				<li>Set class routines and regular activities to help students become comfortable with my teaching style and with the course.</li>
				<li>Maintain empathy and understanding toward students while setting clear boundaries and class rules.</li>
			</ul>
 			<p>I think this semester went a lot more smoothly than last semester. Firstly, I've adjusted to most of the moving parts, deadlines, and things to be aware of at TIU. Secondly, I got to work with new first-year students, so we were able to learn and grow together in their first semester at the university. Thirdly, I was able to teach Tech Lit. In this class, I took on topics that I'm very passionate about such as media literacy and online security, and I was even able to share a little bit of my web development knowledge with students!</p>
 			<p>In the process of planning for my tech lit course, I was able to create some content and share it with my colleagues. You can see an example below. I also made sure to get feedback from my students after we'd met for about a month, and this helped me greatly in planning the rest of the semester. Next term, I hope to spend even more time giving feedback to students as they are in the process of creating their own projects. I also hope to give students stronger guidance on writing good online discussion posts, as this was a major part of the class homework.</p>
 			<p>My speaking and listening classes were a lot of fun. I got to know these new first-year students well over the term. My number one goal for the class was to get students comfortable talking, so we did a lot of fluency activities, free conversation, and games. One issue I'd like to work on for next semester is to encourage even more use of English in class. One idea I learned from my peer observation session is to make sure students have extra work or tasks to complete if they finish early. That way, it will be harder for students to go off task and start chatting in Japanese when they're done with a task. I also want to use English even more in class for meaningful conversation outside of book work so students can practice using English with each other regularly.</p> 
			<p>Overall, I feel pretty good about this term and I'm excited for the next. It will be interesting to re-teach Tech Lit next term to see how I can improve it. I'm also looking forward to working with my first-year Japanese students more. I'm hoping we can keep up the motivation they had in their first semester!</p>
