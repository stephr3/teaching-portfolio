			<h5 id="2018">Fall 2018</h5>
			<p>Overall my first semester was all about finding my way at TIU and getting to know my new students. I taught two J-track compulsory classes: English Communication and Basic Writing. One challenge is that I came in mid-way through the year to 1st-year students who had already learned and adjusted to the previous teacher's teaching style. In addition to this, I was figuring out the specific challenges that come with teaching reading and writing to university students who share the same first language.</p>
			<p>One goal I developed after my first month of teaching was to encourage more English use in the classroom. I worked on this by explicitly teaching classroom English, to mixed results. I think the key is to keep practicing and encouraging this classroom language daily. I also wanted to make sure the learning objectives for each class were simple and clear. I wanted to make sure students felt small successes and like they learned something each day. This is easier said than done when I was a new teacher still figuring out what my students truly needed to learn! One place I think I was more successful in this was in my writing class. I had the goal of teaching a simple writing process - first draft, revision, and final draft. I think by the end of the semester students had grasped the usefulness of this process.</p>
			<p>My Academic Composition class was interesting because it was a completely different population of students. I had nine students from various countries. All of them were quite motivated to improve their essay writing skills. Looking back on this class, I think I struggled balancing general composition skills with grammar and mechanics. I had a lower level class, and some students definitely struggled with writing clear and understandable sentences. I also struggled with feedback. How much feedback should I give? Was it really being read and utilized?</p>
			<p>If I were to teach this class again, I think I would try to create a clearer action plan for my students, building up from creating sentences to paragraphs and essays. I was a bit all over the place in trying to help my students with the many skills they needed to develop, from finding good sources and paraphrasing to using commas correctly and writing great transition sentences. I think it would have been beneficial for us to work on one skill at a time as a class to really master each step of the writing process, in addition to regular grammar and punctuation workshops.</p>
			<p>At the end of the term, I also reflected on writing feedback. One idea I had was to survey students on what types of feedback they prefer so I can tailor my feedback to each student individually. For example, do they prefer general comments on the whole paper, general comments on each paragraph, detailed grammar fixes on one or two paragraphs, or just a grade? This would be interesting to experiment with if I teach a writing class again.</p>



			<h5 id="2019">Spring 2019</h5>
			<p>My goals for my second semester at TIU were as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create content that I'm proud of and share it on the shared Google Drive.</li>
				<li>Reflect regularly on my classes and get student feedback.</li>
				<li>Have clear and intentional goals for each course, unit, week, and class hour.</li>
				<li>Set class routines and regular activities to help students become comfortable with my teaching style and with the course.</li>
				<li>Maintain empathy and understanding toward students while setting clear boundaries and class rules.</li>
			</ul>
 			<p>I think this semester went a lot more smoothly than last semester. Firstly, I've adjusted to most of the moving parts, deadlines, and things to be aware of at TIU. Secondly, I got to work with new first-year students, so we were able to learn and grow together in their first semester at the university. Thirdly, I was able to teach Tech Lit. In this class, I took on topics that I'm very passionate about such as media literacy and online security, and I was even able to share a little bit of my web development knowledge with students!</p>
 			<p>In the process of planning for my tech lit course, I was able to create some content and share it with my colleagues. You can see an example below. I also made sure to get feedback from my students after we'd met for about a month, and this helped me greatly in planning the rest of the semester. Next term, I hope to spend even more time giving feedback to students as they are in the process of creating their own projects. I also hope to give students stronger guidance on writing good online discussion posts, as this was a major part of the class homework.</p>
 			<p>My speaking and listening classes were a lot of fun. I got to know these new first-year students well over the term. My number one goal for the class was to get students comfortable talking, so we did a lot of fluency activities, free conversation, and games. One issue I'd like to work on for next semester is to encourage even more use of English in class. One idea I learned from my peer observation session is to make sure students have extra work or tasks to complete if they finish early. That way, it will be harder for students to go off task and start chatting in Japanese when they're done with a task. I also want to use English even more in class for meaningful conversation outside of book work so students can practice using English with each other regularly.</p> 
			<p>Overall, I feel pretty good about this term and I'm excited for the next. It will be interesting to re-teach Tech Lit next term to see how I can improve it. I'm also looking forward to working with my first-year Japanese students more. I'm hoping we can keep up the motivation they had in their first semester!</p>

			<h5>Fall 2019</h5>
			<p>My goals for my third semester at TIU were as follows:</p>
			<p>Speaking and Listening Classes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Write English Plaza questions in class to make sure students have interesting conversations.</li>
				<li>Teach classroom language. Reward for English use.</li>
				<li>Do more pronunciation work.</li>
				<li>Talk, talk, talk!</li>
			</ul>
			<p>IT Literacy Class:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Provide more guidance for online and in-class discussion.</li>
				<li>Provide more guided spreadsheet practice.</li>
			</ul>
 			<p>I tried to do things a little differently this semester with my speaking and listening classes. First of all, we created class rules and a class contract to help keep students on track with their own goals. I think this was a helpful activity. Secondly, we focused a lot more on TOEIC. We did regular TOEIC listening practice, and students wrote reflections on their performance and how to improve after they took their practice tests. By the end of the semester, students were pleased with their TOEIC scores, and I think self-reflection on their strengths, weaknesses, and study habits helped in this process.</p>
 			<p>IT Literacy was challenging as we had quite a large class size this term. I still was able to provide them with more clearcut guidance on creating WordPress sites, working in Google Docs, and working in Google Sheets. Media literacy activities were also fun and productive. I had some more issues with plagiarism this term, so I'll be sure to use anti-plagiarism tools next term for all assigned writing, including blog posts.</p>
			<p>Next term I will be teaching IT Literacy again, which I am happy about. I'll also be starting with a new batch of Listening and Speaking students, this time at A0 level. It will be a new challenge to work with these students, and I'm excited to adapt textbook materials to best suit their level and learning styles.</p>

			<h5 id="2020">Spring 2020</h5>

			<p>Spring 2020 was, of course, an unprecedented semester filled with plenty of challenges due to emergency remote teaching. I felt pretty confident this term as my schedule was filled with classes that I had already taught, but my first few days online teaching showed me that there were clearly some changes I'd need to make. Here are some goals I brainstormed at the beginning of the semester related to remote online teaching:</p>

			<p>Speaking and Listening Classes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Help build a sense of community among the freshman students.</li>
				<li>Encourage plenty of discussion and speaking activities via Zoom.</li>
				<li>Explore games and fun activities that can be adapted to Zoom.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>IT Literacy Class:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Give crystal clear instructions before sending students to breakout rooms.</li>
				<li>Always show an example for any in-class work or homework assignments.</li>
				<li>Have my LMS system set up more thoroughly than usual, with powerpoints and class materials consistently uploaded.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>For my speaking and listening classes this year, I struggled trying to adapt activities that I normally do in the classroom to the online environment. There are some helpful tools I used such as the Zoom annotation feature, Kahoot, and Flippity. However, I'm still figuring out how to make online courses more fun and interactive, and this is something I will continue to work on in the fall.</p> 

			<p>For the IT Literacy class, I quickly discovered that my students would need even more clear guidance and support on in-class work and outside projects, since they weren't able to confirm with classmates during class that they were on the right track. I immediately got to work creating more robust examples and instructions for our projects. I was also happy with how interactive the class ended up being. Students took well to breakout rooms and in-class discussions. They seemed to enjoy the interactivity,  since many of their other courses were large and lecture-based. I had to drop into rooms at times to make sure that some of the quieter students were contributing, but other than that it went pretty well.</p> 

			<p>Next semester, I'd like to continue to build on solid classroom routines, streamline assessment and grading for myself, and implement exit tickets. I also want to work on some more fun projects for the J-Track classes that will give us a break from book-related work.</p> 
		
			<h5>Fall 2020</h5>

			<p>These were my goals for Fall 2020:</p>

			<p>Speaking and Listening Classes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create more in-class routines.</li>
				<li>Utilize exit tickets.</li>
				<li>Students can brainstorm their own daily discussion questions.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>IT Literacy Class:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Utilize exit tickets.</li>
				<li>Structure grading to be more robust.</li>
				<li>Reduce writing requirements so students can focus more on portfolio projects.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>This term was our second online term. My students and I were more accustomed to online teaching, so I was able to focus on class content and quality rather than frantically adapting my usual teaching plans to Zoom.</p> 

			<p>For my J-Track classes, I focused on giving students more autonomy in choosing daily discussion topics. I also incorporated pronunciation practice, which they enjoyed. I tried to utilize daily exit tickets, which quickly moved to weekly, then bi-monthly. The exit tickets were useful to check whether students were grasping certain concepts or had any questions or concerns, but I think some students were reluctant to voice concerns about the course. Being online makes it tougher to connect with students - I will still have to reflect on the best way to check in with individuals each term to make sure no one is falling through the cracks. I'm pondering implementing one-one-ones next semester.</p>

			<p>IT Literacy class was a lot of fun. I think I overcame some of the initial hiccups from moving it online last term. I utilized weekly exit tickets, but that sort of fell by the wayside at the end of the term. I'll be sure to keep them up next year, perhaps assigning them monthly. I am still struggling with grading a multi-level class on IT skills. All the students are coming in with different abilities, so I believe it's unfair to grade students relative to one another. I have fairly robust rubrics, but I'm still fiddling with my grading philosophy for this course. Next term, the IT Lit teachers will be standardizing our rubrics and perhaps doing some norming exercises, so that should help clarify my grading strategy. Students were able to have more time to work on portfolio projects this term, but I still learned from class reflections that they struggled with meeting deadlines. This class does have a heavy workload. I'll try to leave more wiggle room next term for in-class work days.</p> 
		
			<p>Next semester, I'm taking on a whole new class load. I'll be teaching my first advanced J-Track classes in addition to IT Literacy. I'm excited to move from compulsory classes to electives. I'm especially interested in building content-based and task-based syllabi. There will be plenty of work to do next semester, but I'm excited to grow my teaching practice.</p>

			<h5 id="2021">Spring 2021</h5>

			<p>This semester, classes were switched to an on-demand / in-person format. For half of my classes, I had to prepare videos and materials that students could complete at any time during the week. For the rest of my classes, we were in-person and socially distanced. This semester was my most challenging regarding prep time, assessment, and student engagement. To top it all off, I taught three completely new courses: Advanced Listening and Speaking, Contemporary Global Issues and Japan, and English Projects Workshop.</p>

			<p>For Advanced Listening and Speaking, it was a challenge to figure out what to assign for on-demand days and how much to review in class. About halfway through the semester, I ended up spending about 30 minutes of each in-person class reviewing on-demand materials to reinforce the videos and worksheets students had completed. I found this improved their performance on unit assessments.</p>

			<p>The curriculum for Contemporary Global Issues and Japan was prepared by my colleague, Alex Pellillo. I was grateful to have access to her materials to help plan for the course. Considering the on-demand format, students uploaded monthly group presentations in video format. This worked out pretty well since students were able to watch a few presentations on their own time and respond to their classmates via Moodle forums. The students found it valuable to discuss world issues, especially regarding plastic waste and refugees and displaced persons. I look forward to teaching this class again next semester.</p>

			<p>For EPW, I was able to utilize some of my IT Literacy curriculum and add more of a language learning component for my J-Track students. Students worked in groups to create a LINE chatbot, infographic, video, and app prototype. All the projects related to environmental issues. Our vocabulary and grammar focused on the environment as well as technical language for computer programming, design, filmmaking, and web development. I had a lot of fun teaching this class!</p>

			<p>IT Literacy was much easier to hold in person than fully on Zoom. It is an interactive class where we discuss media literacy issues and share digital projects, so I was happy that students were able to complete some of this work face-to-face. I look forward to making small changes for next semester to improve all of these courses. I'm especially interested in streamlining my own workload to spend less time filming videos or grading participation work for the on-demand days. I'd like to spend more time providing quality feedback for students, meeting with students if needed, and finding great resources for teaching content in class.</p>
